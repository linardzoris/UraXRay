# UraXRay
Hybrid engine based on several X-Ray engine derivatives, aiming for a wide range of technical support. Codes contained are only for engine sources, refer to Open Xray repo if you want to build it. There is no credit reserved for myself, thanks to anyone who contributed to make this engine work. :>
